CREATE TABLE test_publisher (
   pubID Integer,
   pubName varchar(30),
   pubLoc varchar(55),
   PRIMARY KEY (pubID)
);
```

### 1. Show all columns and rows in the authors table. You should get all 23 rows.

```sql
SELECT * FROM authors;
```

### 2. Show the first and last names of all authors. You will get all 23 rows.

```sql

### 3. Show the first and last names of all authors, but this time make the columns labels at the top "FirstName" and "LastName" (no blanks). Use column aliases for this. You will get 23 rows.

SELECT title_id, SUM(qty_ordered - qty_shipped) FROM salesdetails WHERE qty_shipped < qty_ordered GROUP BY title_id;
```

### 6. Which editors don't have a boss? List all editors (first and last names) without a boss (NULL in ed_boss field). There will be three rows in the result.
