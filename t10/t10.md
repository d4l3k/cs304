# Question 1

## (a) Define a star schema for this data warehouse [5 Marks]

### Sales Fact table

* type (FK)
* cid (FK)
* CalendarKey (FK)
* UnitsSold: integer
* GrossRevenue: integer

### Calendar Dimension

* _CalendarKey_: integer
* day: integer
* week: integer
* month: integer
* quarter: integer
* year: integer

### Customer Dimension

* _cid_: integer
* city: string
* zip: string
* rating: integer
* salary: enum(very low, low, medium, high, very high)

### ProductCategory Dimension

* _type_: string
* category: string

## (b) Define a snowflake schema for this data warehouse [5 Marks]

According to Wikipedia, a star schema is just a special case of snowflake
schema. Thus, the answer to 1.a applies here as well.

### Sales Fact table

* type (FK)
* cid (FK)
* CalendarKey (FK)
* UnitsSold: integer
* GrossRevenue: integer

### Calendar Dimension

* _CalendarKey_: integer
* day: integer
* weekID (FK)

#### Week Dimension
* _weekID_: integer
* week: integer
* monthID (FK)

#### Month Dimension
* _monthID_: integer
* month: integer
* quarterID (FK)

#### Quarter Dimension
* _quarterID_: integer
* quarter: integer
* yearID (FK)

#### Year Dimension
* _yearID_: integer
* year: integer

### Customer Dimension

* _cid_: integer
* cityID (FK)
* zipID (FK)
* ratingID (FK)
* salaryID (FK)

#### City Dimension

* _cityID_: integer
* city: string

#### ZIP Dimension

* _zipID_: integer
* zip: string

#### Rating Dimension

* _ratingID_: integer
* rating: integer

#### Salary Dimension

* _salaryID_: integer
* salary: enum(very low, low, medium, high, very high)

### ProductCategory Dimension

* _type_: string
* categoryID (FK)

#### Category Dimension

* _categoryID_: integer
* category: string

## (c) Assume the chosen schema is star schema. How many different cuboids (cubes and sub-cubes) can be there in this warehouse? [2 Marks]

Number of cuboids is given by:

$$ T=\Pi_{i=1}^n (L_i+1) $$

We have a rather high level of dimensionality since there can be an arbitrary
number of ratings, city, zip code, product type, product category, and years.

The fixed dimensions are:

* salary with five levels
* day, 7
* week, 52
* month, 12
* quarter, 4

Thus the number of cuboids is:

$$ (1+5)(1+\# ratings)(1+\# cities)(1+\# zip codes)(1+\# product type)(1+\# product
category)(1+7)(1+52)(1+12)(1+4)(1+\# years) $$

## (d) Using SQL's CUBE operator define a pivoting operation that aggregates the sales of the year 2016 on weeks, product category and salary level. [5 Marks]

``` sql
SELECT weeks, category, salary, sum(GrossRevenue)
FROM s Sales, c Calendar, p ProductCategory, cust Customer
GROUP BY weeks, category, salary
WHERE s.type = p.type AND s.CalendarKey = c.CalendarKey AND s.cid = cust.cid
WITH CUBE
```

## (e) Draw the lattice with the aggregations performed by the operator CUBE(week, category, sLevel) [5 Marks]

# Question 2

Using HRU.

View  | Iteration 1      | Iteration 2
----- | ---------------- | -----------
{c,p} | 6M * 4 = 24M     | Materialized
{p,s} | 2M * 4 = 8M      | 2M * 4 = 8M
{c,s} | 4M * 4 = 16M     | 4M * 4 = 16M
{c}   | 6.5M * 2 = 11M   | 0.5M * 2 = 1M
{s}   | 8M * 2 = 16M     | 8M * 2 = 16M
{p}   | 6.8M * 2 = 13.6M | 0.8M * 2 = 1.6M
{}    | 10M - 1          | 4M - 1

Best view to materialize is {c,p}. The second best view to materialize is tied
between {c,s} and {s}.

# Question 3

## a) Grouping the customers of a company according to their profitability.

This is a datamining task since it's extracting valuable information from
existing data.

## b) Predicting the outcomes of tossing a (fair) pair of dice.

This is not a data mining task since it's simple probability and doesn't require
any stored data.

## c) Predicting the future stock price of a company using historical data.

This is a data mining task since it requires a vast amount of historical data
and algorithms to produce any meaningful output.

# Question 4

Transaction ID | Items
-------------- | -----------------
T1             | Milk, Bread, Mayo
T2             | Milk, Bread
T3             | Milk, Egg, Cheese
T4             | Cheese, Egg
T5             | Cheese, Mayo
T6             | Milk, Egg, Cheese

## 1) Trace the Apriori algorithm on the below transactions with minsup = 33.3% and minconf = 60%.

Minsup = 33.3% = 2/6
